# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

## Additional Tools
Three additional tools that web developers can use includes: 
- Nodejs
- Npm Package Manager
- Github Pages
#### Nodejs
With Nodejs, developers can set up an environment where they can easily run their code without the need of their browser.  Most tools that are run locally are written in JavaScript, so you need a JavaScript interpreter on your computer that can be invoked from the command line (not the one in your browser). Not just Nodejs, there is also [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/), which is known for its speed and powerful APIs
#### Npm Package Manager
Npm package manager is made available by Node for developers. It enables fast and easy installation of other packages required by a developer.
#### Github Pages
As a Web developer, you develop websites right? Now, How do you get your sites published? How do you make it available for users to see and use? You need a deployment tool to enable you do that. That is where Github pages comes in! Github pages and other deployment tools like vercel, Netlify allows for smooth publishing of websites.

With nodejs, you have an environment set up to run your javascript code from your command line without having to use the devtool made available by browsers, Npm package managers to install packages that a developer might need and github pages for publishing websites. There are so many tools out there for developers to add to their toolbox.
